# 3D User Interfaces and Augmented Reality
## 3D Platform Rollaball game
### Description 
Project 1 from Stephen Feiner's 3D User Interfaces course at Columbia University. While a theme was not required, I chose to make a 1980s music themed game. There are three types of players: rolling ball, sliding cube (both controlled by accelerometer), and jumping cylindar (controlled by touch). Built in Unity for iOS. Includes interactive obstacles such as falling objects, a cannon, ferris wheeel, and seesaw. Can be built in Unity and delpoyed to iOS via Xcode. Contact me for assistance, if needed. The assignment instructions with the assigned  specifications for the game can be found in the assignments folder.

[Source Code (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IvE-tDkSugWsQ7RZ7RiVzdoqA3cpwogH?usp=sharing): build can be downloaded and deployed via xcode. As this is a homework assignment that can not be published publicly, please request access via Google Drive if you would like to veiw source code.

### Instructions: 

Welcome to the world of 1980s music! Navigate across seven platforms while avoiding obstacles to build the microphone in time for the big show. Hitting obstacles or falling out of bounds will reduce your health, shown in the top left by 10 musical notes. Lose all 10 notes and you'll have to start over. Change the camera view by hitting the "Change View" button in the top right corner. The default camera view is above and behind the player. The second view is a bird's eye view, centered on whichever platform the ball in currently on. You can zoom or slide the camera forwards and backwards using the sliders in the upper right corner. The third view is a cyclopian view, looking straight ahead from the player's perspective. As you progress through the game, colorful spotlights will illuminate the platform that the player is currently on. Press restart in the bottom right at any time to reset the game. Have fun!

#### Platform 1: Don't Stop Believin, You Can Do it!
Press the start button to begin the game. Control the ball by tiling your phone in the direction that you would like to move. Roll the ball to the cannon, pick a direction, and hit the fire button to launch the ball to the next platform. Careful, hitting a guitar will result in losing points and you might fall out of bound too! 

#### Platform 2: Bad Jukboxes
To reach the next platform, the player needs to cross a piano seesaw bridge. Try to roll across the bridge. The player can not make it across because the seesaw tilts before the player can get to the other side! To solve this, roll up to one of the jukeboxes and slide it onto the seesaw. Now with the added counterweight, the player can make it across the seesaw. 

#### Platform 3: Livin in a Material World, and I am a Material Cube
Once safely across the piano bridge, roll the player into the cube placed on this platform. Now, you've found another piece of the microphone! The ball will attach itself to the top of the cube. You can control the updated player by tilting your device, the same way the ball was controlled. Slide up the ramp to reach the next platform. You may need to build up some speed to make it all the way up!

#### Platform 4: Look out! It's Raining Men!
Don't let any of the men falling from the sky hit you. You'll lose health if they do! A man will fall as soon as the player is positioned underneath it on the platform, so make sure to keep moving across the platform to avoid getting hit by too many men. To get to the next platform, slide onto the ferris wheel. Be careful not to fall off, or you'll have to go back to the start of the platform and get through the storm of men again! From the ferris wheel, slide onto the next platform.

#### Platform 5: Jump! 
Slide into the cylindar located on the platform to complete the microphone. Now that you've completed the microphone, you've almost won! To move the player, tap the screen in the direction that you would like to move. The microphone will hop in that direction. To get to the next platform, hop up the ramp. 

#### Platform 6: I Wanna Dance With Somebody 
Hop over the rotating arm to get to the end of the platform. Careful not to hit the rotating arm, or you may be knocked off the platform. Once you've reached the end of the platform, hop onto the bridge and hop through the golden rings to reach the final platform!

#### Platform 7: I'm Still Standing, I Made it! 
Congratulations! You've built the microphone and made it to the end in time for the big concert! Press restart to play again and try to beat your best time!
