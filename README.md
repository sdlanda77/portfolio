## Coding Choreography

In this course, we explored multiple methods in which code and choreography can interact using different body tracking methods and technologies. The emphasis of this course was less on coding technique and more on how we can critique and analyze movement and code from a choreographer's point of view. Some projects relied on in-person technology such as Xbox Kinect sensors and projectors.

### Various projects in p5.js ([Repo of source code](https://github.com/sdlanda77/portfolio/tree/main/CodingChoreography))

The following projects are samples from this course that are presentable on the web. 

#### Face Tracking with Googly Eyes and Scaling
##### Face mask drawn in dots; bring face closer and further from camera to seperate masks and active/deactive googly eyes

## Artificial Intelligence
### [Coding Homeworks](https://github.com/sdlanda77/portfolio/tree/main/ArtificialIntelligence)
Coding homeworks, via Google Collaboratory. Instructions for the problem set and coding solutions in each file. 

Topics covered included search problems using uninformed and heuristic search, games, constraint satisfaction problems, sequential decision making, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models, inference and sampling, introductory machine learning, decision trees, perceptrons, and neural nets. 

## Creative Embedded Systems (Spring 2021, will be updated as possible throughout the semester. [Repo](https://github.com/sdlanda77/portfolio/tree/main/CreativeEmbeddedSystems))

This course is an extension of a traditional embedded systems design course in which material is taught through independent creative projects. While this class requires technical knowlede, it is not strictly a technical class. 

### Generative Art using visual display and 8 LEDs

## User Interface Design
### Design project 1
Interactive wesbite that connects LGBTQ college students with one another. Includes course and professor review system and information on school resources. This is just a shell, and while it is possible to click through the pages, there is only dummy information and no backend.

### Design project 2 (group project)
Assigned to create a UI for new college students to connect with one anther. This is just a shell, and while it is possible to click through the pages, there is only dummy information and no backend.
